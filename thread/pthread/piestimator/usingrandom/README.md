# Estimate PI 

This is a multithread application that estimate PI using Monte Carlo
simulation.

Despite the benefits discussed, we may easily implement a multithread
application ***incorrectly***. 

Examine the applicaiton in the [usingrandom](usingrandom) directory, and
compare it with the programs in this directory. What is wrong with the one in
the [usingrandom](usingrandom) directory.
